# Bumbler
Why stare blankly at your terminal window when you can clutter it up with awesome progress bars?

Use Bumbler to track the load progress of your [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/)-based projects!  Maybe you'll find a slow gem or two.

```Bash
gem install bumbler
```

## Simple

```Bash
cd rails-project && bumbler
```

## Detailed usage or non-rails projects
### Step 1:
Add bumbler to your Gemfile if you want to use `bundle exec`

```Ruby
gem 'bumbler'
```

### Step 2:
Add the following to your .profile, .bash_profile, .zshrc, .wtfrc or whatever shell config you use

```Bash
export RUBYOPT=-rbumbler/go
```

### Step 3:
Restart your terminal


## Blammo, you're bumbling with bundler and bumbler!
Run a Bundler-based command, and you should see a spiffy progress bar, such as:

```
> rails c
[#########                                                                     ]
( 7/59)  492.04ms loaded data_mapper
> Bumbler::Stats.all_slow_items  #will show you the gems which load the slowest.
```


And then maybe you'll also want to contribute some patches to make your favorite gems load faster.

# Bonus features

## Track load-time of initializers (config/initializers/* and engine initializers)

`bumbler --initializers`

## Configure threshold

`bumbler -t 10` -> show everything slower than 10ms
